//Please research the following methods:
//map
//reduce
//filter
//forEach
//sort
//slice
//pop
//shift
//push
//unshift
//includes
//indexOf
//every

//Give a short description of what the method does, how it works, it's time complexity (if appropriate), and give three examples of it in action!

//Questions to practice:

// One:
// Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:
// [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

// Two:
// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

// Three:
// Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
// Example:
// [ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 ] => 16
// [ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 ] => 6
